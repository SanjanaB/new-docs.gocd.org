# Clone an existing GoCD pipeline

Clone pipeline functionality helps you create a new pipeline from an existing pipeline by giving it a new name. Typically when setting up a pipeline for a new branch, it is very useful to take an existing pipeline and clone it.

If the user is a pipeline group admin, she can clone the new pipeline into a group that she has access to. If the user is an admin she can clone the pipeline into any group or give a new group name, in which case the group gets created.

-   Navigate to the Admin tab
-   Locate the pipeline that needs to be cloned
-   In that row, click on the "Clone" icon.

-   Click "Save"
