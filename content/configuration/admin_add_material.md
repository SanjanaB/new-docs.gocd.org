# Add a new material to an existing GoCD pipeline

Now that you have a pipeline, lets add another material to it.

-   Navigate to the new pipeline you created by clicking on the **Edit** link under the Actions against it. You can also click on the name of the pipeline.

-   Click on the Materials tab.

-   You will notice an existing material . Click on the "Add new material" link.

-   You will get the following message

-   Edit the existing material and specify the destination directory

-   Click "Save".

## Blacklist

Often you do want to specify a set of files that GoCD should ignore when it checks for changes. Repository changesets which contain only these files will not automatically trigger a pipeline. These are detailed in the [ignore](configuration_reference.html#ignore) section of the [configuration reference.](configuration_reference.html)

-   Enter the items to blacklist using ant-style syntax below

-   Click "Save".

## Whitelist

There are cases where instead of ignoring those files or folder/s, you want GoCD to consider only the specified files or folders when checking for changes and ignore the rest. With GoCD whitelisting, you can allow a pipeline to trigger on certain repository changesets.

- Click on "Invert the file filter...." to enable whitelisting

- Click "Save".

**Note** - ```GoCD uses '**' for folder/path and '*' for files.```

## Examples:

```xml
<ignore pattern="doc/**/*" />
```
Ignore everything under the folder **'doc'**, even deeper levels of subfolders/files under doc folder.

```xml
<ignore pattern="doc/*" />
```
Ignore files under the folder **'doc'**, excluding any subfolder.

```xml
<ignore pattern="framework/helper/*.doc" />
```
Ignore files that are under the directory 'framework/helper' and the file extension is **.doc**.

```xml
<ignore pattern="*.pdf" />
```
Ignore files that are under the root directory of SCM repository and the file extension is **.pdf**.

```xml
<ignore pattern="**/helper/*.pdf" />
```
Ignore all the files that is under any **'helper'** folder and the file extension is **.pdf**.

```xml
<ignore pattern="helper/**/*.pdf" />
```

Ignore all the files that are in the nested directory under folder **'helper'** of the repository and the file extension is **.pdf**.
