# Installing GoCD agent

You need to deploy at least one GoCD agent before you can build with GoCD. For the very simplest installation, you can run a GoCD agent on the same machine as your GoCD server.

Before you install the GoCD server or agent, please ensure that you meet the [System Requirements](system_requirements.html).
