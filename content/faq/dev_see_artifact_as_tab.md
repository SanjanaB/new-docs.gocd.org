# See artifacts as sub-tabs in GoCD

After [uploading html reports](../configuration/dev_upload_test_report.html), it is often useful to be able to easily view this information when trying to [understand why the build is broken](dev_understand_why_build_broken.html).

### Example usage

-   Suppose we have configured GoCD to [upload a flash video and html file and display it as a tab](../configuration/dev_upload_test_report.html)
-   Click on the [Pipelines](../navigation/pipelines_dashboard_page.html) tab

-   Click on the job you want to investigate

-   Click on the tab you created

-   Clicking on the tab will load the page, which will start the video!
-   To view the content in a new window, just click "Download Recording"
