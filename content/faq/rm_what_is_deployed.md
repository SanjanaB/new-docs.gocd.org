# Discover what's in an GoCD environment

Before [deploying something into production](rm_deploy_to_environment.html), it is often useful to know what is currently there.

### Example usage

For this example, we will assume we have a stage name "production" that will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server

-   Start at the [Environments](../navigation/environments_page.html) page

-   Click on the name of your "production" stage

-   The [Stage Details](../navigation/stage_details_page.html) page will show every time GoCD has deployed your application
