      <description>GoCD Administration There are four ways to configure pipelines etc.
 Via the Admin UI described below Direct XML edit via the Admin UI&amp;rsquo;s Config XML tab Configuration is possible via Config API Direct XML edit via the file system. By default, Go server polls the filesystem every 5 seconds for changes to cruise-config.xml. The location of this file is indicated in the top right corner of the Admin &amp;gt; Config XML tab.</description>

      <description>Agents on GoCD The Agents page lists all the agents available to the server and their current status.
When an Agent first connects to the Server it is &amp;lsquo;Pending&amp;rsquo;. An administrator must enable the Agent before GoCD will schedule work on that agent.
Administrators can also disable agents. GoCD will not schedule work for a disabled Agent. If a job is building on the agent when it is disabled, that job will be completed; the agent is then disabled.</description>

      <description>GoCD Artifact integrity verification Overview GoCD verifies artifact integrity to ensure that they are unchanged from the point of origin. While executing a job, GoCD applies the following rules if the checksum of the downloaded artifact does not match the checksum at the time of generation of the artifact.
 If the artifact was uploaded using the artifact API, a warning is displayed in the console output for the job If the downloaded artifact is different from the point of generation, the job will be failed with an error in the console output for the job.</description>

      <guid>/configuration/dev_authentication.html</guid>
      <description>Authentication A newly installed GoCD server does not require users to authenticate. This is great for a trial. However, it is one of the first things you should change, as soon as you decide to use GoCD more widely.
GoCD has two methods of authentication built into it: Password-file based authentication and LDAP/Active Directory authentication. You can also choose from a collection of community-maintained plugins for other methods of authentication, such as using Google or GitHub OAuth.</description>

      <description>Authorization With no security switched on, there is of course no authorization either. Once you have configured security, the default is that any user can perform any operation. However, GoCD can limit certain operations to particular Users or Roles, and manage membership of those Roles.
Administrators GoCD allows you to restrict the users who can perform certain functions. Administrators is a special role that allows its members to perform any action in GoCD.</description>

      <description>Auto delete artifacts Introduction GoCD can be configured to automatically delete artifacts if the available disk space on the server is low. GoCD will purge artifacts when available disk space is lower than the given value. Artifacts will be purged up to the point when available disk space is greater than a defined value.
Configuration Specify artifact purge start and end limits You must be logged in as an admin user to configure this step.</description>

      <description> Discover what&amp;rsquo;s in an GoCD environment Before deploying something into production, it is often useful to know what is currently there.
Example usage For this example, we will assume we have a stage name &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; that will automatically deploy a binary onto a production server
 Start at the Environments page   Click on the name of your &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; stage   The Stage Details page will show every time GoCD has deployed your application  </description>

      <description>Choose when a GoCD stage runs Often there are steps in your pipeline that you do not want to happen automatically. For example, you might want to keep binaries from being created for every pipeline (to prevent running out of disk space) or want to choose when your code is deployed to production. Stages in GoCD can be marked as &amp;lsquo;manual&amp;rsquo; just for this purpose.
You can create a manual pipeline by setting the first stage to manual.</description>

      <description>Clone an existing GoCD pipeline Clone pipeline functionality helps you create a new pipeline from an existing pipeline by giving it a new name. Typically when setting up a pipeline for a new branch, it is very useful to take an existing pipeline and clone it.
If the user is a pipeline group admin, she can clone the new pipeline into a group that she has access to. If the user is an admin she can clone the pipeline into any group or give a new group name, in which case the group gets created.</description>

      <description>Concurrent Modifications to GoCD&amp;rsquo;s Configuration GoCD handles concurrent modifications to its configuration. Multiple modifications are merged and saved successfully. Modifications to the same area of configuration would result in a conflict.
Note: Configuration file is maintained in git version control system. GoCD leverages git’s merge feature to merge changes from multiple users. As expected, concurrent changes to the same section by users would result in a conflict.
Successful Merge In case of a successful merge, user would see a success message as below:</description>

      <description>Using SSH keys to access GoCD materials in a containerized GoCD server and agent If you have configured a git repository as a GoCD material, then there are several ways to let GoCD access the repository. One of the popular methods to do so is configuring SSH keys. When using docker for gocd server and agents, it becomes slightly more complex to do this. Below are the steps to configure the ssh keys that can be used with multiple containers at once.</description>

      <description>Use a custom pipeline label When using GoCD to build your application, it is often useful to be able to include extra information in the label GoCD uses. For example, you might want to have your label contain a static major.minor version number in addition to the unique count of the pipeline.
 Click on the Administration tab  Edit the pipeline  Add the label template  Click save  Using material revisions You might also want to include material revision into the pipeline label so that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find a GoCD pipeline by material revision and vice versa.</description>

      <description>Delegating Group Administration A GoCD Administrator can authorize users and roles to be administrators for Pipeline Groups. These group administrators have certain privileges which are explained in the section &amp;ldquo;Privileges of a Group Administrator&amp;rdquo;.
Steps to assign Group Administrators To assign a user as a group administrator:
 Click on &amp;ldquo;Pipelines&amp;rdquo; tab on the Admin section Locate the group you want to assign a group administrator to Click the &amp;ldquo;Edit&amp;rdquo; link for that group Here, you can define permissions for users and roles  In the above screenshot, the GoCD admin has delegated group admin privileges to a user &amp;ldquo;jez&amp;rdquo; and all users defined under the role &amp;ldquo;groupAdminRole&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment GoCD allows you to hand pick which revision of your materials you would like to deploy to your environment. This is a a very common requirement on larger projects which have multiple materials in their deployment pipeline. Sometimes you may wish to have control over which revision of the application is deployed to a particular environment (say UAT).
Select specific revisions of materials to deploy Consider the case where a deployment pipeline &amp;lsquo;deploy_bookstore&amp;rsquo; has 2 materials - Material &amp;lsquo;svn&amp;rsquo; and upstream pipeline &amp;lsquo;bookstore&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Releasing into an environment One of the most useful aspects of having your build mapped as a pipeline, is being able to know exactly what is in a particular environment. For example, you might have a User Acceptance Testing environment into which you want GoCD to automatically deploy your binary. Due to process restriction within your company, you might want to manually install a binary yourself, but have GoCD still retain the information of what is currently released.</description>

      <description>GoCD Elastic Agents Introduction Elastic Agents is an extension-point in GoCD that allows for on-demand agents which are created and provisioned by an elastic-agent plugin when there are jobs to be executed, and terminated when the agents are running idle. These agents can be in a data center or in the cloud or both, and may be physical or virtual.
Developers can start building their own elastic-agent plugins by forking the skeleton plugin and looking at a sample docker plugin, docker swarm plugin as an example reference implementation.</description>

      <description>GoCD unable to poll for changes GoCD server polls for changes to all materials of &amp;lsquo;Auto Triggered&amp;rsquo; pipelines. By default, polling occurs every minute and ten materials at a time. The polling interval and the number of materials to be polled simultaneously are configurable.
GoCD uses SCM commands to poll for changes. For example, to check for any new changes in SVN repository the following command is used:
svn log --non-interactive --xml -v -r HEAD:&#39;revision&#39; &#39;repository-URL&#39;  The SCM command used by GoCD server can hang with no output.</description>

      <description>Job Timeout Introduction GoCD can be configured to automatically cancel jobs that do not generate any console output for a period of time. Default Job timeout options include:
 Never : Jobs will never be timed out by default. You can override this behavior when configuring the job in the job editor Timeout after a period of inactivity : A job will be cancelled if it did not have any console output for a period of time (in minutes)  When a job is timed out, the onCancel task for the job will be triggered.</description>

      <description>Pipeline locking: Ensure only one instance of a GoCD pipeline can run at the same time Sometimes you want to ensure that only a single instance of a pipeline can run at a time. This is important if the stages of a pipeline are interrelated. For example the first stage may set up an environment that is used by the next stage in the pipeline.
If a pipeline is locked then GoCD will not allow any other instance of that pipeline to be scheduled until the currently running one has been completed.</description>

      <description>Managing GoCD agents GoCD is designed to make managing a build cloud extremely simple. This page takes you through the lifecycle of expanding your cloud and maintaining your agents.
Adding a GoCD agent to your cloud The first thing you need to do is install Go agent on the machine you want to add to the cloud.
Once the GoCD agent has been installed and pointed at your GoCD server, go to the Agents tab on the GoCD dashboard.</description>

      <description>Managing artifacts and reports Because all your work is done on remote agents, GoCD provides a mechanism for files to be automatically uploaded to GoCD server following the completion of every job. These files can then be accessed via the GoCD server dashboard, or via the RESTful API.
Publishing artifacts The first step in using the artifact repository is to tell GoCD which files you want to publish. To do this just specify the path to the file or directory relative to the root of the source control checkout.</description>

      <description>Managing dependencies Sometimes you need more complex triggers than a simple pipeline of stages and jobs. In particular, you may want a pipeline to trigger based on the result of a stage in another pipeline. This is possible by adding pipelines as materials.
Creating a dependency Say we have two pipelines - upstream_pipeline and downstream_pipeline . We want downstream_pipeline to automatically trigger following the successful completion of the stage AutoStage1 in pipeline upstream_pipeline.</description>

      <description>Managing Users GoCD&amp;rsquo;s user management features allow you to control access to GoCD and grant role-based permissions.
All user management features depend on an authentication mechanism having been configured in GoCD. Please ensure you have at least one authentication mechanism enabled before attempting to use any of the features mentioned in this chapter.
Adding Users  Navigate to the Admin section Click on the &amp;ldquo;User Summary&amp;rdquo; tab Click the &amp;ldquo;Add User&amp;rdquo; button   Enter a name/email to search for (minimum 2 characters) and click &amp;ldquo;Search&amp;rdquo; This will perform a search across all authentication mechanisms configured (password file and/or LDAP) From the list of results, select the user to add and click &amp;ldquo;Add User&amp;rdquo;  Assigning Roles Roles allow you to group a set of users with similar functional duties and grant them a common set of permissions.</description>

      <description>Notifications It is often useful to receive an email when certain status changes occur in a stage. For example, a developer might want to know when their own check-in has broken the build. Alternatively, a manager might want an email whenever a project is deployed into production. Both of these scenarios can be covered by Notification Filters
Notifications will only work if Security is enabled and mailhost information is correct.</description>

      <description>Ordering of pipelines in GoCD In GoCD, we use two distinct types of ordering of pipelines:
 Schedule order: Chronological order in which pipelines are scheduled. Natural order: Chronological order of pipelines based on material modifications  In most cases the schedule order and natural order match. The user checks in and builds incrementally so the order in which builds are scheduled is the same as the relative order in which changes are checked in.</description>

      <description>GoCD Pipeline Labeling GoCD maintains an internal counter to identify a pipeline. This number increases by 1 for each build. By default, GoCD will use this counter as the pipeline label. This label is also passed to your build as an environment variable: GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER . The pipeline counter increases even if a build fails.
The concept of pipeline counters was introduced in release 1.3.2. In order to maintain backward compatibility with historical data GoCD now uses negative values as counter for pipelines created by older releases of GoCD.</description>

      <description>Publishing artifacts When executing a job on an agent there are often artifacts created that we need to keep around. For example, JUnit creates xml reports that GoCD is able to parse in order to help you understand why the build is broken. You can use GoCD with any JUnit style xml reports. Or you might create a flash video of your UI tests that we want displayed in GoCD.</description>

      <description>GoCD Dependency Management When you have non-trivial dependency pipeline chains, you may have concerns about how dependent pipelines and materials interact. For example, code and tests are checked in as part of the same commit. But code is built and tested in sequence, so the same material version has to be used for pipelines that build and test your code. This section covers some Dependency Management concepts and how GoCD handles certain complex scenarios.</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up seeing the following error:
GoCD will stop scheduling new pipelines until you make more room, either by compressing large files, attaching a larger hard drive, or by deleting unused artifacts. You could also let GoCD manage artifact disk space by enabling auto purge of old artifacts.</description>

      <description>Saving properties about a build When building your code, there can be quite a bit of extra information that you are interested in. For example, you might run EMMA on your code in order to log code coverage. With properties, you can save this information, and even look at the history of a property (by way of an exported spreadsheet).
Example usage Usage: As a developer, I want to save the average cyclomatic complexity of a function (pulled from JavaNCSS).</description>

      <description>What has changed in the current GOCD version? When updating your testing environments to a new version, it is useful to know what changes have been made since it was last updated. Since there is currently no way to get this information in GoCD automatically, there are some extra steps we must take.
Example usage For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that there is a manual &amp;ldquo;UAT&amp;rdquo; stage will automatically deploy and install an executable on your user acceptance testing machine.</description>

      <description>TFS Material configuration You can use TFS SCM as a material for your pipeline. GoCD server and agent uses TFS Java SDK v14.0.3 by default. The TFS SDK is packaged with GoCD; no additional configuration is required. Users can continue to use GoCD with TFS 2012, 2013, 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services.
You will need to configure the following to add a TFS material:
 Material Name: An optional name for the material.</description>

      <description>Run a GoCD pipeline on a schedule To run a pipeline at a given time, use a timer. Timers understand a cron-like specification for when to run a pipeline.
Note that a pipeline will still schedule normally if changes are checked in. If the pipeline should only run according to the timer&amp;rsquo;s schedule then you should also set a manual approval for the first stage of the pipeline to stop it from automatically scheduling when materials change.</description>

      <description>UI testing Because GoCD installs itself as a service (Windows) or daemon (Linux) by default, getting GoCD agents to interact with your operating system&amp;rsquo;s windowing environment can cause problems. Access to a windowing environment is usually required for testing UI applications or for driving browsers for web testing. Here&amp;rsquo;s how you do it.
Windows The first step is to disable the GoCD agent service. To do this:
 Log in to your Windows machine as an Administrative user.</description>

      <description>GoCD Value Stream Map Introduction Value Stream Map helps you visualize your CI/CD workflow. With a single click, it allows you to trace a commit from when it is checked in up to when it is deployed.
A value stream map can be drawn for every instance of a pipeline. It provides you with the ability to:
 See what caused the current pipeline to be triggered. See what downstream pipelines were triggered by the current pipeline.</description>

      <guid>/faq/dev_understand_why_build_broken.html</guid>
      <description> Why is the build broken? Knowing the build is broken is only the first step. Now we need to understand what caused it to break.
Example usage Usage: As a developer, I want to understand why the build is broken.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that in this case, we are on a java project using JUnit as our testing library.
 If we&amp;rsquo;re not already, we need to configure Go to upload JUnit xml reports Click on the Pipelines tab   Click on the failed stage you want to investigate   Click on the failed job   The &amp;ldquo;Failures&amp;rdquo; sub-tab should help you diagnose what is wrong with your build   If you need more information, the &amp;ldquo;Console&amp;rdquo; sub-tab contains everything that was written out to the console (including extra information from Go)  </description>
