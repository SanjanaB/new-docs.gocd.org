# Documentation for GoCD - Continuous Delivery server

This repository contains the source code for the user documentation for [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/). The documentation is available at https://docs.gocd.org/current/.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to GoCD. For information on contributing to GoCD, please see our [contributor's guide](https://www.gocd.org/contribute). A lot of useful information like links to user documentation, design documentation, mailing lists etc. can be found in the [resources](https://www.gocd.org/community/resources.html) section.

To make changes to GoCD's documentation, you can do this:

1. Install all dependencies

    The dependencies for building the documentation are:
  
    - nodejs (known to work with v8.9.4)
    - yarn (known to work with 1.13.0)
    - Ruby (known to work with 2.3.6)
    - Bundler gem (known to work with 1.17.2)
    
    Then run this to get all the dependent gems:
  
    ```shell
    bundle install --jobs 4 --path .bundle --clean
    ```

2. Run the documentation on the local server (defaults to http://localhost:1313)

    ```shell
    yarn run serve
    ```

### Publishing to GitHub pages

The contents of the `public` directory needs to be pushed out to the *[gh-pages](https://github.com/gocd/new-docs.go.cd/tree/gh-pages)* branch of the repository.

```shell
bundle exec rake publish
```

Check the latest changes deployed [here](https://gocd.github.io/new-docs.go.cd/).

#### To run hugo with different arguments

```shell
yarn run hugo [arguments]
```

### Update this repository with current docs changes

Update the list of directories to be updated in the sync script.
Run the sync script to copy over changes from the current [docs repository](https://github.com/gocd/docs.go.cd)
Go through the changes to see if everything can be committed and then push the code.

```shell
bash ./sync.sh
```

### Releasing a new version of the documentation

Assuming current stable is `17.4.0`, you are about to release `17.5.0` and the next version is going to be `17.6.0`, you would execute -

```
CURRENT_VERSION=17.4.0 VERSION_TO_RELEASE=17.5.0  NEXT_VERSION=17.6.0 REMOTE_NAME=upstream rake bump_version
```
